        <p>I have lived in Arizona for most of my life except for a short period on the east coast in Maryland. I grew up in a Catholic family with both of my parents and my older brother.<br>I have a passion for video games and anime; both of which I follow very closely. Currently, I attend Millennium High School as an IB/Honors student, as well as taking a Coding/Computer Science course at West-Mec.</p>
